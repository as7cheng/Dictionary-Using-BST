Introduction

This assignment involves the implementation of a dictionary using Binary Search Trees (BST). The dictionary stores a collection of Dictionary words or definitions (words and their meanings). The user can add one or more word definitions to this dictionary. He can also use this dictionary to retrieve the meaning of any word already added. You are going to learn how BSTs can be used to store keys (words in this assignment) to facilitate insertion and retrieval operations to and from a collection of ordered elements, in an efficient way.
